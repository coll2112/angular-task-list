This is a practice project that was used to learn the fundamentals about Angular.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## JSON Database

This uses the [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) package. Run `npm server` or `yarn server` to start the database. When running, the changes to the task list will update the `db.json` file in the root of the project.
